# HTMXample

Ohi! This is meant to be an experiment to try out htmx and go.

## What is HTMX? Why HTMX?

[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is a library that lets you do modern browser server
transfer stuff from html attributes instead of having to use javascript.

This allows for us to use HTML As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS).

That is, We encode the state and all the actions in the html, update it with
server responses, all without using javascript or losing modern browser
features.

In other words, no clunky web 1.0.

## Why Go?

* Go is simple. Thats basically it. Simple is boring, but simple is easier to
understand, and faster to learn, faster to write, and more stable.

* Go is fast. Go is maybe the fastest language to compile, and it runs nearly as
fast as the fastest of languages (other compiled languages without garbage
collection). It's tooling is some of the best.

* I just kinda like it. It's a pleasure to learn and use. Mostly because of the
above 2 points - the simplicity keeps the cognitive load low, and it's pretty
low overhead to do just about anything. And when you're done the performance
is good.
